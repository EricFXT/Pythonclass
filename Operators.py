#operators are used to perform operations to varables and values
# 1. Arithmetic
# 2. Assignment
# 3. Comparison
# 4. logical

# 1. Arithmetic operators
#Arithmetic operators are used with nuneric values to perform common mathematical operations
#modulus%
print(3%2)

#find out about the exponential and floor operators in python


#2. Assignment operators
# used to assign values to variables
x = 3
y = 9
# x = x + y # x += y
# print(x)

# 3. COMPARSION OPERATORS
# Comparison operstion result to a boolean state
# Boolean is a state that can either be true or false

#a. == Equal
print(x == y)
#b. != not equal
print(x != y)

#h/w
#research on greater than, greater than or equal to and vice versa

# 4#Logical operators
# used to combine conditional statement

#a. and
#works with conditions that are true. returns true if both conditions are true

z = 7
y = 9
x = 3
print(x< y and z < y)

#b. or
#returns true if one of the conditions is false
print(x > y and z < y)

#c. not - reverse the result, returns false if the result is true
print(not((x > y and z < y)))
